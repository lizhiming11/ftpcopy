How to install ftpcopy
       This document describes how to download, compile, test and
       install ftpcopy.


   System requirements:
       The ftpcopy  package  is	 meant	to  run	 under	UNIX  and
       -lookalikes.

       If you want to run the self check you'll have to install a
       few additional software packages	 (see  below),	but  they
       aren't needed to run ftpcopy.



   Create a /package directory:
	 $ mkdir /package
	 $ chmod 1755 /package
	 $ cd /package
       You  may	 use another directory. No program in the ftpcopy
       package	cares  where  it  is   installed.   /package   is
       recommended.

       The latest published ftpcopy package is:

       http://www.ohse.de/uwe/ftpcopy/ftpcopy-0.6.7.tar.gz

       You can alternatively download it through FTP:

       ftp://www.ohse.de/uwe/ftpcopy/ftpcopy-0.6.7.tar.gz



   Unpack the package:
	 $ gunzip ftpcopy-0.6.7.tar.gz
	 $ tar -xpf ftpcopy-0.6.7.tar
	 $ rm ftpcopy-0.6.7.tar
	 $ cd web/ftpcopy-0.6.7


   Compile and install the programs:
	 $ package/install


   Where commands and documentation are installed:
       By    default	the    binaries	   are	  installed    in
       /package/web/ftpcopy-0.6.7/commmand.   (replace	/package/
       by  the	directory  where  you  you  unpacked  the ftpcopy
       distribution in).  Symbolic  links  to  the  commands  are
       created	in  /command/  and, for compatibility reasons, in
       /usr/local/bin.
       Manual	     pages	  are	     installed	       in
       /package/web/ftpcopy-0.6.7/doc.	 Symbolic  links  to  the
       manual pages are created under /usr/local/man.

       If you don't like this then:
	 $ package/compile && package/check
	 $ cp command/* /whereever/you/want/bin
	 $ cp doc/* /whereever/you/want/doc



   Self check:
       compile/install	(or  compile/check)  try  to   run   some
       automated  tests is a few additional software packages are
       available. If these tests fail the software  will  not  be
       install.	 If  some  or  all of the needed packages are not
       found in $PATH then ftpcopy will be installed.



   Packages needed to run the self test:
       publicfile
	      The self check needs a ftp server. The  ftp  server
	      included in the publicfile package doesn't need any
	      special  entries	in  /etc/passwd	 and  is   highly
	      secure.

	      The  self check expects to find the publicfile ftpd
	      in /usr/local/publicfile/bin/ftpd. If you, for  any
	      reason,	want   to  run	the  test  manually,  and
	      publicfile is installed somewhere else, for example
	      in /usr/bin, you may run
		make PUBLICFILE_FTPD=/usr/bin/ftpd check
	      in the compile directory.

	      See http://cr.yp.to/publicfile.html.


       ucspi-tcp
	      The  tcpserver  program  is needed to open a socket
	      (127.0.0.1, port 50000) and to run  the  publicfile
	      ftp server program.

	      See http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp.html.


       daemontools
	      The  supervise  program  is  used to start and stop
	      tcpserver.

	      See http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html.

       The tests take some time. Things are fine if they  do  not
       print anything.


   How to report success: (not mandatory)
	 $ mail uwe-generic-counter@ohse.de <compile/auto-systype

       Please  do  not	send this email if the self-check failed.
       Send an problem report to the mailing list instead.



   Cleaning up:
       If you are short on disk space you may remove the  compile
       and src directories:
	 $ rm -rf compile src



   Mailing list:
       To  subscribe  to  the ftpcopy mailing list send a mail to
       ftpcopy-subscribe@lists.ohse.de. The content is ignored.

       You do not need to subscribe to the mailing list, it is an
       open  one.   But,  if you are not subscribe, make sure you
       mention this in the mail.

       Please include the ftpcopy version number,  the	operating
       system  and  it's version and any possible relevant output
       of the  failing	program.   Please  include  compile/auto-
       systype in your posting.

       If your system is a GNU/Linux one then please include name
       and version  of	your  distribution  and	 your  C  library
       version number (as printed by ldd --version).
