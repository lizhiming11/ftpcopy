2001-05-22	Uwe Ohse <uwe@csl42.csl.de>

portab:   socks5 as of socks5-v1.0r11 doesn't include a wrapper for 
          poll, but has one for select influencing internal state in

ui:       cd back from sub directories as soon as they are left.
          impact: temporary files are created in the target directory.
          the old behaviour wasn't clean with regards to file system

ui:       ftpcopy.c: make help messages more clear.
ui:       ftpcopy.c: document default of local-dir to .
ui:       ftpcopy.c: make that default only apply if -n is used.

version:  0.3.5

2001-02-14	Uwe Ohse <uwe@fjoras.ohse.de>

bug:      ftpcopy --version showed "--version" as program name
          if and only if ftpcopy wasn't calling with an absolute path 
          in argv[0]. This also affects error messages.
internal: updated scan_long.c, scan_sign.c, strhash_ente.c, uogetopt.c
          and uogetopt.h from the repository.

2001-01.14	Uwe Ohse <uwe@fjoras.ohse.de>

portability: some version of reiserfs on linux doesn't honor utime() if
             the function is called before the file is closed. Found
             and patched by Felix von Leitner <leitner@fefe.de>.
             impact: the date of mirrored files was wrong.
internal:    now actually use futimes() if available.5
internal:    updated socket_tcp.c socket_udp.c strhash_ente.c from the
             repository.
ui:          implemented "--account" option: send argument to the server
             if it asks for an ACCT command. impact: common.c, ftpcopy.h
             ftpls.c, ftpcopy.c.
version:     0.3.4

2000-10-02	Uwe Ohse <uwe@serak.ohse.de>

bugfix:   no validity check on remote files names was done.
          impact: security breach if the FTP server uses names like
          ../../../../etc/passwd. Solution: ignore files with / in the name.

2000-09-21	Uwe Ohse <uwe@serak.ohse.de>

version:  0.3.3
internal: use new strhash version. changed ftpcopy.c to fit.

          Matthias Andree <matthias.andree@stud.uni-dortmund.de>.

2000-09-03	Uwe Ohse <uwe@serak.ohse.de>

internal: updated uogetopt from repository.
internal: updated uoinstall from repository.
internal: removed strlen calls from ftpcopy.c.
version:  0.3.2
doc:      fix spurious comma in ftpcp.pod. (spotted by Matthias Andree)
bugfix:   don't flush before \r\n in ftp_cc_write_cmd_s and
          ftp_cc_write_cmd_ss. Was due to a misunderstanding
          of the way buffer_pustflush works.
          impact: old proftpd version crash, unneeded TCP traffic.
          Spotted by Matthias Andree <matthias.andree@gmx.de>.
internal: use strhash instead of dynhash. impact: avoid possibly
          CRC collision problems.

2000-08-11	Uwe Ohse <uwe@serak.ohse.de>

ui:       ftpparse.c didn't know about the format used on at least
          one IP address behind ftp.nai.com.

2000-08-10  Uwe Ohse  <uwe@serak.ohse.de>

internal: shut up a gcc warning in ftpcopy.c
internal: understands the listing format of ftp.nai.com.
bugfix:   used buggy old env_get (didn't hit, due to luck).
ui:       oom() exists 111 (bailout.c)
internal: timeoutio.h, open.h: library sync
ui:       (uoinstall, premake) a number of make variables
          may influence the installation.
version:  0.3.1

2000-08-08  Uwe Ohse  <uwe@serak.ohse.de>

          success.
version:  0.3.0

2000-06-10  Uwe Ohse  <uwe@serak.ohse.de>

bugfix:  directory deletions didn't work.
ui:      added --include option.

2000-05-18  Uwe Ohse  <uwe@serak.ohse.de>

ui:      add option "-L" / "--list-options" to ftpcopy and ftpls.

         LIST command.

2000-02-08  Uwe Ohse  <uwe@serak.ohse.de>

    * Release 0.2.0

    * ftpcopy.c: (download) forgot to close the socket if
      the server tells us that the file is not available.

    * ftpcopy.c: (delete) stopped to work reliably in 0.1.3. Oops.

    * uoio.c, uostr.c: library function update. Nothing serious.

2000-01-15  Uwe Ohse  <uwe@serak.ohse.de>

    * ftpcopy.c: close the data connection before reading the servers
      final answer. Seems to be needed for some ftp servers (what
      does the standard say about that?).

2000-01-14  Uwe Ohse  <uwe@serak.ohse.de>

    * Release 0.1.2
    * ftpcopy.c: implemented option to deal with symbolic links
      on broken ftp servers.
