.section "How to install ftpcopy"
.paragraph
This document describes how to download, compile, test and install ftpcopy.
.LINE
.subsection "System requirements:"
The ftpcopy package is meant to run under UNIX and -lookalikes.
.paragraph
If you want to run the self check you'll have to install a few additional
software packages (see below), but they aren't needed to run
ftpcopy.
.paragraph
.LINE
.subsection "Create a /package directory:"
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ mkdir /package
  $ chmod 1755 /package
  $ cd /package
.HTML </pre>
.fi
You may use another directory. No program in the ftpcopy package cares
where it is installed. /package is recommended.
.paragraph
.LINE
.subscection "Download ftpcopy:"
The latest published ftpcopy package is:
.paragraph
.extlink http://www.ohse.de/uwe/\*(PA/\*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz \*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz
.paragraph
You can alternatively download it through FTP:
.paragraph
.extlink ftp://www.ohse.de/uwe/\*(PA/\*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz \*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz
.paragraph
.LINE
.subsection "Unpack the package:"
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ gunzip \*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz 
  $ tar -xpf \*(PA-\*(VE.tar
  $ rm \*(PA-\*(VE.tar
  $ cd \*(CL/\*(PA-\*(VE
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.LINE
.subsection "Compile and install the programs:"
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ package/install
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.subsection "Where commands and documentation are installed:"
By default the binaries are installed in \fB/package/\*(CL/\*(PA-\*(VE/commmand\fR.
(replace /package/ by the directory where you you unpacked the ftpcopy 
distribution in). Symbolic links to the commands are created in 
\fB/command/\fR and, for compatibility reasons, in \fB/usr/local/bin\fR.
.br
Manual pages are installed in \fB/package/\*(CL/\*(PA-\*(VE/doc\fR. Symbolic
links to the manual pages are created under \fB/usr/local/man\fR.
.paragraph
If you don't like this then:
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ package/compile && package/check
  $ cp command/* /whereever/you/want/bin
  $ cp doc/* /whereever/you/want/doc
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.paragraph
.subsection "Self check:"
\fBcompile/install\fR (or \fBcompile/check\fR) try to run some automated 
tests is a few additional software packages are available. If these
tests fail the software will not be install. If some or all of the
needed packages are not found in $PATH then \*(PA will be installed.
.paragraph
.subsubsection "Packages needed to run the self test:"
.options
.option publicfile
The self check needs a ftp server. The ftp server included
in the publicfile package doesn't need any special entries
in /etc/passwd and is highly secure.
.optionparagraph
The self check expects to find the publicfile ftpd in
\fI/usr/local/publicfile/bin/ftpd\fR. If you, for any reason, want to
run the test manually, and publicfile is installed somewhere else, for
example in /usr/bin, you may run 
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  make PUBLICFILE_FTPD=/usr/bin/ftpd check
.HTML </pre>
.fi
in the compile directory.
.optionparagraph
See 
.extlink http://cr.yp.to/publicfile.html "the publicfile home page" .
.option ucspi-tcp
The tcpserver program is needed to open a socket (127.0.0.1,
port 50000) and to run the publicfile ftp server program.
.optionparagraph
See 
.extlink http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp.html "the ucspi-tcp home page" .
.option daemontools
The supervise program is used to start and stop tcpserver.
.optionparagraph
See
.extlink http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html "the daemontools home page" .
.endoptions
.paragraph
The tests take some time. Things are fine if they do not print anything.
.LINE
.subsection "How to report success: (not mandatory)"
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ mail uwe-generic-counter@ohse.de <compile/auto-systype
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.paragraph
Please do not send this email if the self-check failed. Send an
problem report to the mailing list instead.
.paragraph
.LINE
.subsection "Cleaning up:"
If you are short on disk space you may remove the compile and src 
directories:
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ rm -rf compile src
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.paragraph
